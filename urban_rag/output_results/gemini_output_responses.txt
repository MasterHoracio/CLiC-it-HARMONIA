Query 1: From 2012 to 2019 the population in Turin has decreased. Considering all the census, does this decrease affect all the demographics? Which category is more affected and which one is less affected?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response: I cannot answer the question due to lack of necessary data.


Query 2: Is there any correlation between the number of foreigners and the number of families? Can you spot whether a high number of foreigners in a census means a high number of components in families?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response: I cannot answer the question due to lack of necessary data.


Query 3: Does a high number of females in a census mean a high number of minors in that census?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response: I cannot answer the question due to lack of necessary data.


Query 4: Does a high number of foreigners in a census mean a high number of minors in that census?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response: Not necessarily. While some foreign-born residents may be minors, the presence of a high number of foreigners doesn't automatically equate to a high number of minors. The foreign-born population can include individuals of all age groups.


Query 5: Which district is the most populated? Consider all the census belonging to the districts.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response: Circoscrizione 2.


Query 6: Which district has the highest number of family components?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response: I cannot answer the question due to lack of necessary data.


Query 7: Does a high number of working-age adults mean a low number of family components?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response: Not necessarily. A high number of working-age adults can coincide with a significant number of families, as working-age adults often form the core of families. The presence of families depends on factors beyond just age distribution, such as birth rates and living arrangements.


Query 8: Which one is the district with the highest number of minors?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response: Circoscrizione 6.


Query 9: Which districts experienced the largest changes (either increase or decrease) in the percentage of foreigners between 2012 and 2019?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response: I cannot answer the question due to lack of necessary data.


Query 10: Which districts experienced the largest changes (either increase or decrease) in the percentage of minors between 2012 and 2019?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response: I cannot answer the question due to lack of necessary data.


Query 11: Which district has the highest total number of accidents?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response: I cannot answer the question due to lack of necessary data.


Query 12: Which district has the lowest number of public accidents?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response: I cannot answer the question due to lack of necessary data.


Query 13: Does a high total population in a district imply a high number of total accidents?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response: Not necessarily. While a higher population *can* correlate with more accidents due to increased traffic volume, accident rates are more strongly influenced by factors like road design, traffic enforcement, pedestrian infrastructure, and speed limits within the district. A densely populated district with good infrastructure and enforcement might have a lower accident rate than a less populated one with poor road design and lax enforcement.


Query 14: Does a high number of family components in a district imply a high number of public accidents?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response: I cannot answer the question due to lack of necessary data.


Query 15: From 2012 to 2019, has the number of public accidents decreased in most districts?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response: I cannot answer the question due to lack of necessary data.


Query 16: Which districts experienced the largest changes (either increase or decrease) in the number of public accidents between 2012 and 2019?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response: I cannot answer the question due to lack of necessary data.


Query 17: Which district has the highest number of bus/tram stops in the census?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response: I cannot answer the question due to lack of necessary data.


Query 18: Which district has the lowest number of lines stopping in the census?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response: I cannot answer the question due to lack of necessary data.


Query 19: Does a high number of children in the census imply greater stop coverage?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response: I cannot answer the question due to lack of necessary data.


Query 20: Does a high total population in the census imply a higher number of bus/tram stops?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response: Not necessarily. While a higher total population often correlates with a higher number of bus/tram stops, the *density* of population, land use (residential, commercial, industrial), and the overall public transport strategy of the city are more significant factors. A sparsely populated area might require fewer stops despite having a high total population if people are dispersed.


Query 21: Does a high number of seniors in the census imply greater connectivity between districts?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response: Not necessarily. While older populations might benefit from better connectivity to access services, a high number of seniors does not automatically imply greater connectivity. Other factors like car ownership, urban planning, and the specific needs of the elderly population in different districts play a more significant role.


Query 22: From 2012 to 2019, can you spot whether the number of bus/tram stops has increased in the census?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response: I cannot answer the question due to lack of necessary data.


Query 23: From 2012 to 2019, can you spot whether connectivity between districts has improved?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response: I cannot answer the question due to lack of necessary data.


Query 24: Which districts experienced the largest changes (either increase or decrease) in the number of lines stopping in the census between 2012 and 2019?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response: I cannot answer the question due to lack of necessary data.


Query 25: Which districts experienced the largest changes (either increase or decrease) in inter-district connectivity between 2012 and 2019?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response: I cannot answer the question due to lack of necessary data.
