    "1": "Between 2012 and 2019, the population of Turin declined by 4.32%, and this trend affected most demographic groups. Both male and female populations decreased at nearly the same rate (−4.34% and −4.31% respectively), indicating no significant gender disparity. The number of minors saw a notable decline of 5.96%, while the foreign (legally registered) population experienced the most significant drop, decreasing by 6.48%, together with the number of working-age citizens (-6.28%). In contrast, the senior population was the only group to increase, growing by 2.05%.",
    "12": "To evaluate whether there is a relationship between the number of public transport stops and lines in a census area and the number of traffic accidents, we combined the total number of stops and lines per census and performed a regression analysis against the recorded number of accidents. While the results suggest there might be some association between these variables, the analysis yielded a coefficient of determination (R²) of 0.1, indicating a weak correlation. In other words, the presence of more stops and lines does not strongly predict the number of accidents in a given census. This implies that other factors are likely to play a more significant role in accident occurrence than public transport infrastructure alone.",
    "19": "There is no significant correlation between the number of minors in a census area and the number of public transport stops located within it. Specifically, the number of stops does not appear to be directly influenced by the density of minors within a 500-meter buffer around the census centroid. This conclusion can be confirmed through regression analysis performed on the dataset.",
    "18": "The most well-connected district is District 2 (Santa Rita, Mirafiori Nord, Mirafiori Sud). To evaluate connectivity, we considered three factors aggregated at the district level:\nThe total number of public transport stops\nThe total number of lines\nThe average distance between stops across census areas within each district\nTo combine these into a single connectivity score, we assigned weighted importance to each component. The number of stops and the number of lines were each given 25% weight, while 50% of the total weight was assigned to the average distance. This is because the average distance measure is a degree of freedom indicating how connected every stop is with respect to the others.\nUsing this weighted approach, District 2 achieved the highest connectivity score in 2012, with the second-highest in 2019, confirming its sustained strength in public transport infrastructure over time."
