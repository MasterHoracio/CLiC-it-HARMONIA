In District 2 of Turin, Italy, there exists a notable relationship between various demographic and safety indicators for the year 2019. The total number of accidents appears to be strongly correlated with both population size and minors' presence within the district, indicated by high coefficients of 0.9 and 0.84 respectively when compared against these metrics. This suggests that areas with higher concentrations of people, particularly those under 18 years old, may experience more frequent accident occurrences overall. Conversely, public accidents show significant correlations with population size and minor populations at lower magnitudes of 0.7 and 0.65, implying a weaker but still substantial link. In contrast, family components display little to no association with either type of accidents, evidenced by low coefficients of 0.03 and 0.2. These findings highlight distinct patterns regarding the distribution of accidents across demographics within this specific district.

Here is a comprehensive narrative that summarizes the correlations between various demographic and transportation metrics for each district in Turin, Italy:

Turin's urban landscape reveals interesting patterns when examining the relationships between population demographics and public transportation coverage across its districts. A notable connection exists between population size and average distance from stops, indicating that areas with higher populations tend to have longer distances to bus stops, with coefficients ranging from 0.62 to 0.65. Furthermore, this trend holds true for both minors and seniors, suggesting that younger and older residents alike face similar challenges accessing public transportation services. In contrast, the relationship between total population/senior/minor population and stop coverage shows weaker correlations, at approximately 0.2-0.3, signifying that while there may not be a direct link between these variables, they do share some degree of association. These findings provide insight into potential disparities in access to transportation services within Turin's districts, warranting further investigation to inform targeted improvements.
